# MART
An Exploration of Planes, Graphics, Geometries and Fractals. The Maths behind every digital drawing.

This project is in its early stages. I am in the process of diplaying and minipulating fractals, computing the image using compute shaders (moderngl) in python, displayed using pygame.
code is pretty rough, I dont have a full plan to reach the goals of Mart. So at the moment I am creating programs to learn the software and get some of the maths worked out, before compiling everthing I know into a full application.

the current goal: to create an app that delves into maths in a visual, entertaining way. I would like this app to be educational, teaching the maths that goes into the calculating and programming of what is being displayed.

in fractal.py, that is me learning how to use pygame, and display a bitmap that was generated using the formula for a fractal. 
in compute_shaders.py, this is me learning how to use compute shaders to generate the image. and learnt how to manipulate those images with the mouse to explore the fractals generated. scroll to zoom (only at the centre for the moment). unlock or lock the screen with L. when unlocked, the location of the mouse over the image determines the complex value used in the current equation being used.

the end goal for the fractal section is a sub program where the user can imput equations for the complex plain and explore the fractals that are generated.
